# Tabbies
## What is Tabbies
Tabbies is a social media platform build with the sole purpose of connecting the people who share common hobbies. On this platform people can share picture, videos and audio of their hobbies on their feed with some text. Something like microblogging. Others on the platform will be able to see the shared content. People can also filter-out the content based on the choice of the content they want to see. Further-more people can approach other people using the email id that is asked during the signup process.<br>
Tabbies much like instagram share a concept of usernames where each username is uniquely identifiable and searchable. People can search each other by this username using the in app real-time search features.

**You can find out the images in the image folder at the root directory. Images with m postfixes are the one taken to showcase the UI on a mobile device**

## Key Features
Here are some of the key highlights of the project.
<li> The Project uses bootstrap in its frontend, enabling a highly responsive website that scales to whatever screen the project is viewed on.
<li> There is realtime suggestion engine in the project that suggests the username that based on the few characters entered in the search box.
<li> Each profile will have an interest linked to it that will be setup by the user during signup process. Any posts made by that user will be tagged with the interest type the uses posses.
<li> Each post will show the user who posted the post, the image/video content of the post and text accompanied with the post.
<li> Users will also be able to filter out the post type based on the tags enabling them to explore a wide variety of post beyond the interests set by them during signup. 

## Future Scopes
<li> A websocket library, socket.io has been implemented in the project. Using this implementation a chat system can be introduced in the future version of the code.
<li> A follow system can also be introduced later allowing to selectively see the contents they want to consume.
